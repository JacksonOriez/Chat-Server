# Chat-Server
This project is one that I worked on for my Object-Oriented Programming class (CS 180 - Purdue University). This project is a working chat server that is written all in java. The program requires one device to run the server class so that others can run the client class and chat with each other or just with the server manager. The server is equipped with a filter that filters out bad words that are specified by the badwords.txt file. The server also prints out the time down to the second when printing out a message from a user. Clients are also able to input a username that others can see when they send a message. If no username is specified, then the username is set to Anonymous.
